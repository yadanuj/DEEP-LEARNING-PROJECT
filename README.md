üöÄ Fashion MNIST Classification using CNN - TensorFlow



üìå Overview
This project showcases a complete deep learning pipeline for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to accurately classify fashion items into 10 distinct categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results through metrics and sample predictions.

üéØ Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Implement a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.

Train the model on Fashion MNIST, a dataset of grayscale clothing images.

Evaluate model performance through metrics and visualizations.

Predict and visualize sample outputs for qualitative analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load & Preprocess Data
Dataset loaded from tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.

Images normalized to range [0, 1] for better training.

Reshaped to (28, 28, 1) to match CNN input format.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build CNN Model
Architecture:

2 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation.

MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality.

Flattening followed by Dense layers.

Final Dense layer with softmax for 10-class classification.

Compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model
Trained over 5 epochs with validation data.

Metrics tracked: Accuracy and Loss for both training and validation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate Performance
Plotted accuracy and loss curves.

Generated confusion matrix using Scikit-Learn and visualized it with Seaborn.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Predict and Visualize Results
Displayed sample predictions with true labels.

Correct predictions shown in green, incorrect ones in red.

üíª Sample Code Highlights
```# Load and preprocess
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
x_train, x_test = x_train[..., np.newaxis], x_test[..., np.newaxis]

# Build CNN
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

üìä Results
Final Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on both training and validation datasets.

Confusion Matrix: Helped identify model strengths and weaknesses in classifying similar items.

Sample Predictions: Visual confirmation of correct and incorrect classifications.

üìà Future Improvements

Add Dropout layers for regularization.
Train for more epochs to improve accuracy.
Explore data augmentation to enhance robustness.
Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit.
